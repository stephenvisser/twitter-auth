# Appengine & Twitter To Authenticate

I played around with several different platforms for authentication, but didn't find any to my liking. For flexibility and power, I decided to get an example app up and running for use in [Dreamiam](http://dreamiam.com).

[Tweepy](http://tweepy.github.com/) is a mature twitter API for Python that I should have used all along. It's API is excellent, and it does a great job of separating concerns and using a relatively small codebase and few to no dependencies.
